Hello \<COMPANY\>,

  As a tech company with a strong engineering culture, it is my understanding that one of
  your goals is to promote the growth of your employees.  To that end, I humbly request
  that you provide your employees with what I would like to call a _hack budget_.

  This budget would help facilitate learning and skill development outside of an
  employee's normal routine.  Our field is constantly changing field and being able to
  explore unfamiliar paradigms and new tools is critical in both the employee's and the
  company's future.

  We will be putting our money put towards our soldering irons, private instances, dns
  entries, technical books and resources both phyiscal and digital in hopes of refining
  our craft.  We often have projects that we would like to tinker with, but have trouble
  getting started simply because there's the extra step in planning out and purchasing
  the resources we need.  Sometimes it's enough to stall us for weeks or months at a
  time.  Please help reduce this friction and lower these barriers to entry.

  With you as our patron, we will spend our time after hours creating spaghetti code as
  well as beautiful interfaces, but you'll see us grow either way.  The amount we would
  spend is a pittance when compared to your operating expenses, and we'll always be
  thankful that you were there helping us grow.

Sincerely,<br />
  Selfie
