_Java was like having a rich lawyer as a brother. He was fun when he was younger, but now heâ€™s a black hole that sucks away all the joy in a 100-mile radius.
-Bruce A. Tate in Seven Languages in Seven Weeks: A Pragmatic Guide to Learning Programming Languages_

Learning is a very scary process; everything you learn only serves to show you how much you don't know.  Hacker School has been in session for about three weeks now, and now I'm just very deep in things I don't know.  I started wanting to learn about AI and some functional programming paradigms, but now I've shifted my focus towards programming languages.  I figured that as a race that is so dependent on tools, I ought to get to know some and how they're used, and which are best for the job.  As a developer, its important to add more tools to my toolbox, and experiment with different processes that I'm not familiar with.  I won't be learning about programming language design, compilers, interpreters etc; instead I'll be taking a dive into some of the languages from the book I've quoted above.  Eventually, I'd love to finish all of them.

As someone who has only ever really known one language very well (Java), and has only done serious work with statically typed, compiled langauges that are very similar to each other, I really wasn't getting the whole picture of programming.  I'm starting to realize that for things other than schoolwork, you can't just stick with one language.  Before I'd kept my head down and simply believed that Java was the best because of its huge user base and that I wouldn't need to learn anything else, but thats just silly.
